// Explicitly fall back onto `en` as the default. For "backwards compatibility" (for the last
// five years!), defining a locale will cause moment to silently set that locale as the
// global default. This means that for users who didn't have their browser set to a language
// that we have available here, the most-recently-imported locale will be used rather than
// `en` (which is the default for both moment and this extension).
